"""
This module contains unit tests to validate the behavior of the MATLAB `launch` function
under various conditions. The tests ensure that the function handles different scenarios 
correctly, such as missing files, invalid data, and empty input folders. The tests use 
pytest fixtures to set up the necessary test environments and simulate these conditions.
