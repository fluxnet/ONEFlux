NEE PROCESSING RESULTS DESCRIPTION

This file includes halfhourly NEE estimate and related uncertainty. Two different source of uncertainty are evaluated: the random uncertainty and the one due to the ustar filtering.
The starting dataset is NEE already corrected by storage and de-spiked (method described in Papale et al 2006 Biogeosciences, z=5). The ustar filtering has been based on thresholds calculated using two different methods (Barr et al 2013 and modified version of Reichstein et al 2005) and for each of the two methods using 100 bootstrapped datasets (for a total of 200 ustar thresholds estimates for each year).

Two different methods have been used to extract the ustar thresholds to be applied:
- yearly (identified in the variables names ending with "_y"): the thresholds found for each year and the years before and after have been put together and from their join population the final threshold extracted (ustar thresholds varying among years).
- common (identified in the variables names ending with "_c"): all the thresholds found in the different years have been put together and final thresholds extracted from this dataset (each year filtered with the same ustar threshold).
Note that if the dataset includes up to two years of data the two methods give the same result and only the _y is provided.

In both the _y and _c versions, 40 NEE datasets have been created filtering the original NEE using 40 different ustar values extracted from the thresholds datasets at percentiles [1.25:2.5:98.75]. These 40 NEE versions have been used as basis for all the derived variables provided.

The random uncertainty in the measurements has been estimated starting from the filtered NEE using two hierarchical methods: for half hours where original fluxes are available the random uncertainty is calculated (method 1) as the standard deviation of the fluxes measured in a moving window of +/- 7 days and +/- one hour with similar meteorological conditions (as for the MDS gapfilling: TA +/- 2.5 °C, VPD +/- 5 hPa, SW_IN +/- 50 W m-2 if radiation is higher than 50 W m-2, +/-20 if lower). Random uncertainty for gapfilled halfhours or original halfhours where it has been impossible to find at least 5 measurements in the moving window with similar meteorological conditions, is estimated (method 2) as the median of the random uncertainty (calculated with method 1) of similar fluxes, where similar is defined as in the range of +/- 20% (but not less than 2 umolCO2 m-2 s-1). NEE is always expressed as umolCO2 m-2 s-1
