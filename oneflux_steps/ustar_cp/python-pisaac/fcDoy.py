    doy is a day-of-year function
    that converts the serial date number t to the day of year.
    See datenum for a definition of t.
    doy differs from other formulations in that the last
    period of each day (denoted as 2400 by mydatevec)
    is attributed to the day ending 2400
    rather than the day beginning 0000.
