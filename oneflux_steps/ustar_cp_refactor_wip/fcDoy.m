%	doy is a day-of-year function 
%	that converts the serial date number t to the day of year. 
%	See datenum for a definition of t.
%
%	doy differs from other formulations in that the last 
%	period of each day (denoted as 2400 by fcDatevec) 
%	is attributed to the day ending 2400 
%	rather than the day beginning 0000.
