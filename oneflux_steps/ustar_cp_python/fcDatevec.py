    function [y,m,d,h,mn,s]=mydatevec(t)
    was written by Alan Barr to return 2400 UTC rather than 0000 UTC.
    NOTE:
     This function has been rewritten to preserve the intent of
     the original code (as received from Carlo Trotti).  Under Octave,
     the original code did not work as expected.  For a 30 minute time
     step, the Octave "datevec" routine returned minutes as 29 or 59
     with seconds as 60!  This meant that 00:00 was never converted t0
     24:00 the previous day as intended.
     This function converts times of 00:00 to 24:00 the previous day.
