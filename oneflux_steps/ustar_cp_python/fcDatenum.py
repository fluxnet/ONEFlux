def datenum(Y, M, D):
    """
    Convert date to serial date number.

    This function converts a given date specified by year (Y), month (M), and day (D)
    into a serial date number. The serial date number is the number of days since a 
    fixed starting point: January 1st 1 AD.

    Parameters:
    Y (int): Year of the date. Can be negative for years BC.
    M (int): Month of the date. If 0, it is interpreted as January.
    D (int): Day of the date. If 0, it is interpreted as the last day of the previous month.

    Returns:
    int: Serial date number corresponding to the input date.

    Notes:
    - Year 0 is treated as a leap year.
    - If the day (D) is 0, it is adjusted to the last day of the previous month.
    - If the month (M) is 0, it is adjusted to January.
    - Negative years are treated as if they are in the year 1 AD, with adjustments for leap years.

    Examples:
    >>> datenum(2023, 10, 5)
    739164
    >>> datenum(0, 3, 1)
    61
    >>> datenum(-1, 12, 31)
    0
    >>> datenum(0,24,31)
