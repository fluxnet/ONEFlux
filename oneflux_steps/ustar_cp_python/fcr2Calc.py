def fcr2Calc(y=None, yHat=None):
    """
    Calculate the coefficient of determination (R^2) for the given observed and predicted values.

    Parameters:
    y (array-like): Observed values.
    yHat (array-like): Predicted values.

    Returns:
    float: The coefficient of determination (R^2), which indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).

    Notes:
    - SSreg (Sum of Squares of the regression) is calculated as the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values and the mean of the observed values.
    - SStotal (Total Sum of Squares) is calculated as the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the mean of the observed values.
    - RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) is calculated as the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values and the observed values.
    - R^2 is then calculated as the ratio of SSreg to SStotal.

    Example:
    >>> y = [3, -0.5, 2, 7]
    >>> yHat = [2.5, 0.0, 2, 8]
    >>> fcr2Calc(y, yHat)
